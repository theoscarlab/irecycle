      "Are these real followers?",

      "How do you do it?",
      "I'm glad you asked, it's magic. Actually it's pretty simple. Each day we'll perform many tasks in order to grow your account, following, unfollowing, liking, etc to organically grow your audience.",
      "Will this unfollow any accounts I've personally followed?",
      "Yes. Any account not following you upon purchase will be unfollowed during this campaign. If you want to remain following certain profiles, please send the geek a white list of these accounts immediately after purchase.

This allows you to solely focus on posting the best material possible, while we focus on bringing you the right audience to view your posts.  It is important that you continue posting content regularly to your account, as potential new followers only tend to follow active accounts.",
      "Why does the number of new followers each month vary?",
      "There are several factors. In general, it is related to the size of the account from the start and target niche. Once we get good momentum with growing your followers, the faster we can run with results every month.",
      "Why should I post content to my account regularly?",
      "It is important to continue posting content to your account on a regular basis. Since these are real people, they're much more likely to follow and remain following an active account.",

      "New campaigns are generally underway within 48 hours, and the geek will be in touch as soon as it kicks off to let you know. ",
      "How does the targeting work?",
      "Once you provide us with your ideal customer, we'll focus our efforts on a particular target or niche. For example, if your product or service targets moms, then that's who we'll work on getting moms to follow you.",
      "Do I have to verify my account?",
      "You will likely need to verify your account. This happens from multiple computer logins. Your social media platform is just confirming with you to secure your account. Don’t worry, your account is 100% safe.\n",

I reached out a few times to try and dial our targeting & the response was short & unaccommodating. Following teenagers who post pics of doritos & selfies so they follow us back gives us zero value. I wish our account manager would have been more willing to coordinate with us to target better. Instead the response we received was \"It's not perfect, watch this video, post more content.\" "

Unfortunately, their staff doesn't interact or follow up with you every month or when numbers/activity starts decreasing to improve the service. I would update my growth info and see growth for about 3 weeks and then it would go stagnant. With a bit of interaction from their staff, I think it would work much better. I also don't REALLY think that everything was updated in the way I had asked for as I was getting the same type of fans on insta that I asked to be changed. "

We were engaged to provide some new accounts to follow and that helped create a surge of activity - but then slowed again.  We've currently been stalled for weeks.\n\nIn general, there needs to be better communication like periodic updates of where we are at, what the next steps are, and what (if anything) was needed from us."

Very little urgency, follow through, or regular updates on campaign progress.  Didn't seem to be focused on conversion, or even meaningful insights along the way. Was expecting expert advise but was asked to decide strategy, pricing, & copywriting. We lost over $1K with this gig in 4 mos. Not a good experience :("
